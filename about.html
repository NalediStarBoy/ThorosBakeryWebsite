    <p>
      Thoro's Bakery was founded with the passion to bring freshly baked delights to the heart of our community. It all started in a cozy kitchen where traditional family recipes were combined with a creative touch to craft breads, pastries, and treats that warm both the heart and the soul.

      We believe in using the finest ingredients, sourced locally whenever possible, to ensure every bite is filled with authentic flavors and freshness. From buttery croissants and fluffy scones to crusty artisan breads, each creation is made with meticulous care and a dash of love.
